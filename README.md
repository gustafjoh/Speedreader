## ⚙️ How It Works

### Speed Reading Method (RSVP)
ReadFast uses **Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP)** technique:
- Shows one word at a time
- Keeps words in the same position on screen
- Highlights the middle letter in red
- Automatically adds pauses at sentence and paragraph breaks
- Reduces unnecessary eye movement and increases reading speed by 2-3x!

### Reading Speed
Speed is measured in **WPM (Words Per Minute)**:
- **100-200 WPM** - Slow, for difficult texts
- **300 WPM** - Normal reading speed (default)
- **600+ WPM** - Speed reading

## 🔧 Technology

- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Modern styling and animations
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - No dependencies, clean and simple code
- **CORS proxies** - For fetching content from external websites

## 📝 Project Structure

```
ReadFast/
├── index.html      # Main document
├── style.css       # Styles and design
├── script.js       # JavaScript logic
└── README.md       # This file
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Could not load the page"
- Check that the URL is correct
- Try a different website
- Some sites may block proxy access

### "Could not extract text"
- The website may not have content in standard format
- Try using the direct text input instead

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Start slow** - Begin at 200-300 WPM if you're new to speed reading
2. **Keep focus** - Keep your eyes on the red letter
3. **Pause when needed** - You can pause anytime to reflect
4. **Practice makes perfect** - Reading speed increases with practice

## 🌍 Why Speed Reading Works

- **Reduced eye movement** - Words stay in one place
- **Visual anchoring** - Red letter keeps focus point steady
- **Minimal subvocalization** - Harder to "hear" words in your head at high speeds
- **Flow state** - Rhythm helps maintain engagement
